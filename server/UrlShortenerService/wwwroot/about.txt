Authorized users can create short links by clicking the 'Add New URL' button, where they enter the original link and a description. Subsequently, the program generates a shortened URL, which is then stored in a database associated with the original URLs. When a user accesses the shortened URL, the system searches the database, retrieves the corresponding original URL, and redirects the user to it. Authorized users also have the capability to delete URLs they've added and view detailed information about all the URLs.
